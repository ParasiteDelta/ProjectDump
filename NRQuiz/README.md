# NRQuiz
NimrodQuiz, a Nim rewrite of a Rust rewrite of a Python tool I wrote to generate simple math problems.

I heard of Nim and figured that I would give it a go, and while it behaves like a proper Python, that includes both Python's positives and Python's negatives,
and this includes a lead developer telling someone to just write their own parsing routine for BASIC STRING CONCATENATION!

So I probably won't stick with the language, but damn was it simple to write something like this compared to Rust.
