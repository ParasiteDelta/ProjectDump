# ProjectDump
A place where I put my scraps

#### So, why did you just throw everything in here?
Well, a few reasons. For one, this makes it simple to archive small tinkering projects for me and gives me and easy way to manage changes or revert. True, local VCS is better, but I'm being lazy.   
The second reason is that maybe a fellow tinkerer will find something on here useful, though I doubt it.   
Thirdly, why not?
